In recent years, the community has begun to figure out some pretty effective methods of learning from the enormous amounts of unlabeled data on the internet. The success of transfer learning from unsupervised models has allowed us to surpass virtually all existing benchmarks on downstream supervised learning tasks. As we continue to develop new model architectures and unsupervised learning objectives, \"state of the art\" continues to be a rapidly moving target for many tasks where large amounts of labeled data is available."
